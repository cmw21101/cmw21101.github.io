<h1> CHANNELCEEZUS</h1>
<p> ChannelCeezus is currently under construction. At its pinnacle, I want ChannelCeezus to be a small collection of poetry written by others and myself. As I continue to build my website it will include commentary on politics, science, psychology, dream scienc, and popular culture. It will also include musical playlists and art produced by friends and associates. I will call each piece: A Visionary Stream of Conscious. </p>

<h2> A Visionary Stream of Conscious: Poetry. U from U by: Ceezus</h2>

<p>U from U
u starting to feel nervous/u starting to feel like the curtain closing
u starting to feel like u becoming nothing/done. is what you've become.
Life ain't shit/And u come to notice.
That u aint either/ Ppl try to convince u/That you're important
But that's because they're your people/U gotta get off me.
U gotta stop tryna stop me./They supposed to be with u/
They supposed to love u and believe in u.
And these days ur people r the only ones that seem to/
u dont believe in u.
Motivation and drive diminished.
u know better; but u cant do this alone/
u call up on God and he gone make u strong/
something to remember is: always stay strong</p>

<h3 style="color: #cc9900; text-align:center"> A Visionary Stream of Conscious: RUSSIA...(I meant) American Politics </h4>
<font face="verdana; color: red"> Well, what is conscious without speaking on Russia? At this point America has become analogous to Russia. Our democracy is being attacked by a foreign entity. Scratch that, it seems as if our democracy is being attacked from the inside. The inside attack being influenced by a sinister, foreign entity. The whole thing about this situation is the shift in feelings on Russia. 8 years ago, if you asked anyone on the right or far-right, how they fell about Russia, their reply would be close to a McCarthy-esque blow-up. Now, they want to say how Russia-US relatons should be friendly. They make it seem as if Russia just ain't that bad. However, I would like to turn everyone's attention to: Crimea, the Ukraine, and Syria. Not to mention the way Putin is said to kill off political opponents. It is even believed that Putin rigged his own elections to continue his stay in power. Members of the right, far-right, and alt-right cannot continue to stand by blinded and allow our democracy to be attacked. However, as we all have learned, if they do stand by then the special counsel who was appointed to lead investigations into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia will not stand by. One big piece of irony in this situation for Trump though: EMAILS.

<h3 style="color: cc9900;text-align:center"> A Visionary Stream of Conscious: Cognitive Neuroscience </h3>
<p style="color: #cc9900">This section is dedicated to the fied of Cognitive Nueroscience, specifically, memory. There are a few different types of memory we utilize. Sensory, short term, and long term memory. Sensory memory is the short-lived retention of sensory information, measureable in milliseconds to seconds. Short term memory is the retention of information over seconds to minutes. Just as there are subdirectories of directories pertaining to computer science, there are subdirectories of directories (short term and long term memories) pertaining to memory. A "subdirectory" of short term memory is working memory. Working memory is the retention of task-relevant information lasting seconds to minutes. This information can be engaged by sensory memory or long term memory, meaning it has the potential to become long term or sensory memory. Long term memory is the retention of memory over a long span of time (hours to years.) Two subdirectories of long term memory is declarative and nondeclaritive memory. Declarative memory is knowledge to which we have conscious access. Nondeclaritive memory is knowledge we typically have no conscious awareness of, like motor and cognitive skills. The table below gives a few specifities on sensory memory, short term and long term memory.</p>
